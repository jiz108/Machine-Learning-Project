A simple comparison between KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression models on a given data set of loan records.

Please read the code for information about the data and the implementation of classifiers.

*The results may be improved by engineering new features or using different hyperparameters, I just create some simple predictions only for demonstrating the use of different classifiers from the scikit-learn library.
